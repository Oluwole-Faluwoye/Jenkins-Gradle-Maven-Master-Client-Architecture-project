Step 1: Enable the Amazon Linux Extras repo for Java 11

sudo amazon-linux-extras enable java-openjdk11
sudo yum clean metadata


‚úÖ Step 2: Install Java 11 JDK

sudo yum install -y java-11-openjdk-devel
This installs JDK 11, including the compiler javac.

‚úÖ Step 3: Set Java 11 as the default
Amazon Linux 2 might already have Java 1.8 or 17 installed, so now we‚Äôll use alternatives to enforce Java 11:

üîÅ Set default Java version:

sudo alternatives --config java
Select the option that points to Java 11 (usually something like /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk/bin/java).
Enter the corresponding number (e.g., 2) and press Enter.

üîÅ Set default javac version:

sudo alternatives --config javac
Again, choose the one for Java 11.

‚úÖ Step 4: Set JAVA_HOME globally
üóÇ Option A: Set it via /etc/profile.d/java.sh


echo "export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk" | sudo tee /etc/profile.d/java.sh
echo 'export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH' | sudo tee -a /etc/profile.d/java.sh
sudo chmod +x /etc/profile.d/java.sh
source /etc/profile.d/java.sh
This sets the environment variable system-wide for all users, including Jenkins, Maven, etc.

‚úÖ Step 5: Confirm setup
Run the following:


java -version
javac -version
echo $JAVA_HOME
You should see something like:


openjdk version "11.0.25" 2025-04-16
javac 11.0.25
/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOW WE NEED TO INSTALL Jenkins that is packaged with JAVA 11

You‚Äôll need to install a Jenkins version that fully supports Java 11, including a Java 11-compatible remoting.jar.

üéØ Use Jenkins 2.361.4 or earlier
Jenkins 2.361.4 is the last LTS version that works fully with Java 11.

After that, newer versions of Jenkins (and its agents) require Java 17.



1. Install Jenkins 2.361.4

sudo wget https://get.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins-2.361.4-1.1.noarch.rpm

sudo yum install -y jenkins-2.361.4-1.1.noarch.rpm

This will give you:

A Jenkins core that runs on Java 11

An agent (remoting.jar) that is also Java 11-compatible

2. Restart Jenkins

sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
sudo systemctl restart jenkins

3. Confirm Java version on master

java -version
Should show Java 11.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

üîÅ Optional: Set for Jenkins specifically
If you're using a Jenkins user (e.g., jenkinsmaster), add it to their .bash_profile:


echo "export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk" >> /home/jenkinsmaster/.bash_profile
echo 'export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH' >> /home/jenkinsmaster/.bash_profile
Then:


sudo chown jenkinsmaster:jenkinsmaster /home/jenkinsmaster/.bash_profile


 Configure Master and Clinet Configuration
Click on "Manage Jenkins" >> Click "Nodes and Cloud" >> Click "New Node"
Click New Node
Node name: Maven-Build-Env
Type: Permanent Agent >> Click CREATE
3.1. Configure "Maven-Build-Env"
Name: Maven-Build-Env
Number of Executors: 5 (for example, maximum jobs to execute at a time)
Remote root directory: /opt/maven-builds
Labels: Maven-Build-Env
Usage: Use this node as much as possible
Launch method: Launch agents via SSH
Host: Provide IP of Maven-Build-Server
Credentials:
Login to Maven VM
Run the following commands
sudo su

passwd root

provide the password as "root"


‚úÖ 2. Allow root login over SSH

Edit the SSH config file:

vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config 

Look for:

#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password

‚û°Ô∏è Change it to:


PermitRootLogin yes

‚úÖ Uncomment it (remove the #) and set to yes.

Also ensure this is set:

PasswordAuthentication yes

This enables login with passwords (instead of just key pairs).

‚úÖ 3. Restart the SSH service

sudo systemctl restart sshd

‚úÖ 4. (Optional but recommended) Allow PAM
Also ensure this is enabled in /etc/ssh/sshd_config:


Restart SSH again if you change it.

systemctl restart sshd

‚úÖ 5. Test root SSH login from your terminal

ssh root@<MAVEN_VM_PUBLIC_IP>
